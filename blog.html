            <h3>Awardee of Perempuan Inovasi - Web Developer Fullstack Bootcamp</h3>
            <p class="meta">30 JULY 2025 </p>
            <p>
                I feel grateful to be selected as one of the 40 participants who continue to the Full Stack Web Development and UI/UX Design Bootcamp in Perempuan Inovasi Scholarship 2025 program. Coming from a non-IT background, I once doubted whether I could keep up. Yet, the Basic Course taught me that learning technology is not about being an expert from the start, but about having the courage to try, the consistency to learn, and the determination to grow.
                <br>
                <br>
                For me, this opportunity is not only about mastering coding and design, but also about building women’s confidence to enter the digital world that often feels out of reach. I hope this experience will become a stepping stone for my future career in technology, and at the same time, a way to inspire and empower other women to take their own steps forward.

            <h3>LINK WOMEN</h3>
            <p class="meta">8 July 2025</p>
            <p>
                Out of curiosity, I decided to join the Link Women program, a collaboration between UN Women, LinkedIn, and Markoding that aims to strengthen women’s career readiness through training in digital marketing, artificial intelligence (AI), as well as fundamental knowledge of gender equality and eliminating bias in the workplace. What started as just trying something new turned out to be an eye-opening experience that gave me valuable insights I had never considered before.
                <br>
                <br>
                Beyond the training, Link Women also encourages participants to fully utilize LinkedIn as a platform to expand professional networks, access job opportunities, and support career growth. From this experience, I realized that sometimes a small step taken out of curiosity can become the starting point of bigger changes — not only for ourselves, but also as inspiration for others to take their own leap.
